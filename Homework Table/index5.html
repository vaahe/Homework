    <h1>HTML</h1>
    <p><mark>The HyperText Markup Language</mark> or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be
        displayed in a
        web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as <a href=""><b>Style Sheets</b></a> (CSS) and
        scripting languages
        such as <a href="">JavaScript</a>.<br />
        <a href="">Web browsers</a> receive HTML documents from a <a href="">web server</a> or from local storage and
        render the documents into
        multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for
        the appearance of the document.
        HTML markup consists of several key components, including those called tags (and their attributes),
        character-based data types, character references and entity references. HTML tags most commonly come in pairs
        like
        and, although some represent empty elements and so are unpaired, for example. The first tag in such
        a pair is the start tag, and the second is the end tag (they are also called opening tags and closing tags).

        Another important component is the HTML document type declaration, which triggers standards mode rendering.
        HTML documents imply a structure of nested HTML elements. These are indicated in the document by HTML tags,
        enclosed in angle brackets thus:
        .[71][better source needed]

        In the simple, general case, the extent of an element is indicated by a pair of tags: a "start tag"
        and "end tag". The text content of the element, if any, is placed between these tags.

        Tags may also enclose further tag markup between the start and end, including a mixture of tags and text. This
        indicates further (nested) elements, as children of the parent element.

        The start tag may also include element's attributes within the tag. These indicate other information, such as
        identifiers for sections within the document, identifiers used to bind style information to the presentation of
        the
        document, and for some tags such as the used to embed images, the reference to the image resource in the
        format like this.

        Some elements, such as the line break or do not permit any embedded content, either text or further
        tags. These require only a single empty tag (akin to a start tag) and do not use an end tag.

        Many tags, particularly the closing end tag for the very commonly used paragraph element, are optional. An HTML
        browser or other agent can infer the closure for the end of an element from the context and the structural rules
        defined by the HTML standard. These rules are complex and not widely understood by most HTML coders.

        The general form of an HTML element is therefore. Some HTML elements are defined as empty elements and take the
        form
        attribute2="value2">. Empty elements may enclose no content, for instance, the <br> tag or the inline
        tag. The name of an HTML element is the name used in the tags. Note that the end tag's name is preceded by a
        slash character, /, and that in empty elements the end tag is neither required nor allowed. If attributes
        are not mentioned, default values are used in each case.
